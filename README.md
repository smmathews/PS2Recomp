This project statically recompiles PS2 ELF binaries into C++ and provides a runtime to execute the generated code.

### Modules

* `ps2xAnalyzer`: scans ELF/functions and writes TOML config (`stubs`, `skip`, instruction patches).
* `ps2xRecomp`: reads TOML + ELF, decodes R5900 instructions, and generates C++ output.
* `ps2xRuntime`: hosts memory, function registration, syscall dispatch, and hardware stubs.

### Features

* Translates MIPS R5900 instructions to C++ code
* PS2-specific MMI and VU0 macro support.
* Single-file or multi-file output.
* Configurable stubs, skips, and instruction patches.
* Instruction-driven syscall handling.

### How It Works
PS2Recomp works by:

* Parsing a PS2 ELF file to extract functions, symbols, and relocations
* Decoding the MIPS R5900 instructions in each function
* Translating those instructions to equivalent C++ code
* Generating a runtime that can execute the recompiled code

The translated code is very literal, with each MIPS instruction mapping to a C++ operation. For example, `addiu $r4, $r4, 0x20` becomes `ctx->r4 = ADD32(ctx->r4, 0X20);`.

### Current Behavior

* `stubs` entries generate wrappers that call known runtime syscall/stub handlers by name.
* `stubs` also supports address bindings with `handler@0xADDRESS` for stripped games (for example `sceCdRead@0x00123456`).
* Address bindings also support generic return handlers for triage: `ret0`, `ret1`, `reta0`.
* Recompiler now tries relocation-symbol auto-binding at callsites (`J/JAL`) before raw address dispatch; when relocation symbol is known (for example `sceCdRead`), it can call runtime handlers without manual address mapping.
* Recompiler discovers additional internal static entry targets and emits `entry_...` wrappers for those addresses.
* For unresolved static `J/JAL` sites, generated code falls back to `runtime->lookupFunction(0x...)`.
* `skip` entries are not recompiled and generate explicit `ps2_stubs::TODO_NAMED(...)` wrappers.
* Recompiled `SYSCALL` now calls `runtime->handleSyscall(...)` with the encoded syscall immediate.
* Runtime syscall dispatch tries encoded syscall ID first, then falls back to `$v1`.

### Requirements

* CMake 3.20+
* C++20 compiler (currently tested mainly with MSVC)
* SSE4/AVX host support for some vector paths

### Build

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ran-j/PS2Recomp.git
cd PS2Recomp

cmake -S . -B out/build
cmake --build out/build --config Debug
```

### Usage

Preferred workflow for retail or stripped games:

1. Open the ELF in Ghidra.
2. Run `ps2xRecomp/tools/ghidra/ExportPS2Functions.java`.
3. Use the exported TOML and CSV map.
4. Recompile with the exported TOML:

```bash
./ps2_recomp config.toml
```

Fallback workflow for quick local experiments or ELFs with debug symbol :

```bash
./ps2_analyzer your_game.elf config.toml
```

Use this only when you do not have a Ghidra project yet. The native analyzer is faster to start, but it is less accurate on stripped retail games and more likely to miss internal callable entry points.

See the [Ghidra Workflow](ps2xAnalyzer/Readme.md#3-ghidra-integration-for-retail-and-stripped-games-preferred) for the recommended path.

Then build generated output and link with `ps2xRuntime`.

### Configuration

Main fields in `config.toml`:

* `general.input`: source ELF path.
* `general.ghidra_output`: recommended function map CSV exported from Ghidra.
* `general.output`: generated C++ output folder.
* `general.single_file_output`: one combined cpp or one file per function.
* `general.low_memory_mode`: reduce peak output-generation memory by avoiding retained disassembly strings and forcing serial output generation. Generated instruction comments are still emitted; disassembly text is produced while writing each output file instead of being kept in memory.
* `general.output_worker_threads`: number of output-generation workers (clamped to nproc * 2). A positive value uses exactly that many workers. `0` uses `nproc - 1` when at least two hardware threads are available, otherwise serial output generation. `1` forces serial output generation.
* `general.patch_syscalls`: apply configured patches to `SYSCALL` instructions (`false` recommended).
* `general.patch_cop0`: apply configured patches to COP0 instructions.
* `general.patch_cache`: apply configured patches to CACHE instructions.
* `general.stubs`: names to force as stubs. Also accepts `handler@0xADDRESS` to bind a stripped function address directly to a runtime syscall/stub handler. Includes generic handlers `ret0`, `ret1`, `reta0`.
* `general.skip`: names to force as skipped wrappers.
* `general.external_call_target_manifests`: optional array of `external_call_targets.txt` paths emitted by other recompile invocations (e.g. a separately recompiled overlay); their call targets that land inside this invocation's functions are registered as additional entry points. Each invocation writes its own `external_call_targets.txt` into `general.output`.
* `patches.instructions`: raw instruction replacements by address.

Address binding for stripped ELFs:

* Use `handler@0xADDRESS` inside `general.stubs` to map a stripped function start directly to a runtime handler.
* Example: `sceCdRead@0x00123456` binds function start `0x00123456` to `ps2_stubs::sceCdRead(...)`.
* Generic temporary handlers are available: `ret0@0xADDR`, `ret1@0xADDR`, `reta0@0xADDR`.
* Before manual binding, prefer recompilation from a Ghidra-exported TOML/CSV first. The extra boundaries and synthetic entry points are usually more important than manual early triage.
* The address must be the function start in that exact ELF build.
* Addresses are not portable across different games/regions/builds.
* The handler name must exist in runtime call lists (`PS2_SYSCALL_LIST` or `PS2_STUB_LIST`).

Example:

```toml
# stripped function binding by address:
stubs = ["sceCdRead@0x00123456", "SifLoadModule@0x00127890"]
# temporary return handlers:
stubs = ["ret0@0x001D9410", "ret1@0x001D5BC8", "reta0@0x0024B7C0"]
# mixed example:
stubs = ["printf", "sceCdRead@0x00123456", "SifLoadModule@0x00127890"] 
```

### Runtime

To execute the recompiled code.

`ps2xRuntime` currently provides:

* Guest memory model and function dispatch table.
* Some syscall dispatcher with common kernel IDs.
* Basic GS/VU/file/system stubs.
* Foundation to expand and port your game.

### Game Override Hooks

Game overrides are runtime-side, build-scoped patch modules.
 
A game override is C++ code that runs during `loadELF` and can replace function bindings by address for one specific game build. This is separate from recompilation output and separate from global runtime stubs/syscalls. 
 
API:

* Header: `ps2xRuntime/include/game_overrides.h`
* Register macro: `PS2_REGISTER_GAME_OVERRIDE(name, elfName, entry, crc32, applyFn)`
* Direct bind helper: `ps2_game_overrides::bindAddressHandler(runtime, addr, "handler")`

Use Game Override modules when:

* You need per-game/per-build routing or patches without polluting global behavior.
* You need to bind many addresses, or install custom replacement logic for a specific title.

#### Recommended Iteration Loop

1. Run with minimal config and no aggressive skipping.
2. Fix hard blockers first (`function not found`, syscall TODO, critical IO stubs).
3. Use temporary return stubs only to classify call importance.
4. Promote temporary fixes to real implementations.
5. Move per-game hacks into game overrides keyed by ELF metadata.
6. Re-test from cold boot after each batch.

### Limitations

* Graphics Synthesizer and other hardware components need external implementation
* VU1 microcode is not complete.
* Hardware emulation is partial and many paths are stubbed.
